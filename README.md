## ⚡ What is this?

This tool takes your Boolean expression and *bam* — converts it into a Proteus-compatible circuit diagram. No more dragging gates like it's 2005. Just paste your expression, hit convert, and download your circuit screenshot ready to rock your DLD lab.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- ✅ **Automatic optimal gate selection** — Smarter logic, fewer gates.
- ✅ **Dynamic input handling** — Adds input pins based on how many variables your expression has.
- ✅ **`.png` screenshots** — As if came from Proteus.
- ✅ **Clean, readable layout** — No more spaghetti circuits.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Go to [expression-to-circuit.vercel.app](https://expression-to-circuit.vercel.app/)
2. Enter your Boolean expression (like `A.B.C + A.B.C' + A.C + A'.B.C`)
3. Wait for it to update
4. Click **Download** to download the `.png` file
5. Open it in Proteus and flex on your lab mates
